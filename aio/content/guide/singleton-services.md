## Providing a singleton service

An injector created from a module definition will have services which are singletons with respect to
that injector. To control the lifetime of services, one controls the creation and destruction of
injectors. For example, a route will have an associated module. When the route is activated, an
injector is created from that module as a child of the current injector. When you navigate away from
the route, the injector is destroyed. This means that services declared in a route module will have
a lifetime equal to that of the route. Similarly, services provided in an application module will
have the same lifetime of the application, hence singleton.

The following example module is called, as a convention, `CoreModule`. This use of `@NgModule` creates organizational infrastructure and gives you
a way of providing services from a designated NgModule.

<code-example path="ngmodules/src/app/core/core.module.ts" region="user-service" title="src/app/core/core.module.ts" linenums="false">

</code-example>

Here, `CoreModule` provides the `UserService`, and because `AppModule`
imports `CoreModule`, any services that `CoreModule` provides are available
throughout the app, because it is a root of the injector tree. It will also be a singleton because the injector lifetime of the `AppModule` is for the duration of the application.

Angular registers the `UserService` provider with the app root
injector, making a singleton instance of the `UserService`
available to any component that needs it,
whether that component is eagerly or lazily loaded.

The root `AppModule` could register the `UserService` directly,
but as the app grows, it could have other services and
components like spinners, modals, and so on. To
keep your app organized, consider using a module such as `CoreModule`.
This technique simplifies the root `AppModule` in its
capacity as orchestrator of the application as a whole.

Now you can inject such services into components as needed. In terms of
Angular NgModules, you only need to define the services in one `@NgModule`.
See [JS Modules vs. NgModules](guide/ngmodule-vs-jsmodule) for
more information on how to differentiate between the two.

As a general rule, import modules with providers _exactly once_,
preferably in the application's _root module_.
That's also usually the best place to configure, wrap, and override them.

作为一个通用的规则，应该*只导入一次*带提供商的模块，最好在应用的*根模块*中。
那里也是配置、包装和改写这些服务的最佳位置。

[Tour of Heroes tutorial](tutorial).

## `forRoot()`

If a module provides both providers and declarations (components, directives, pipes) then loading it in a child injector such as a route, would duplicate the provider instances. The duplication of providers would cause issues as they would shadow the root instances, which are probably meant to be singletons. For this reason Angular provides a way to separate providers out of the module so that same module can be imported into the root module with `providers` and child modules without `providers`.

1. Create a static method `forRoot()` (by convention) on the module.

2. Place the providers into the `forRoot` method as follows.

<!-- MH: show a simple example how to do that without going to deep into it. -->

To make this more concrete, consider the `RouterModule` as an example. `RouterModule` needs to provide the `Router` service, as well as the `RouterOutlet` directive. `RouterModule` has to be imported by the root application module so that the application has a `Router` and the application has at least one `RouterOutlet`. It also must be imported by the individual route components so that they can place `RouterOutlet` directives into their template for sub-routes.

If the `RouterModule` didn’t have `forRoot()` then each route component would instantiate a new `Router` instance, which would break the application as there can only be one `Router`. For this reason, the `RouterModule` has the `RouterOutlet` declaration so that it is available everywhere, but the `Router` provider is only in the `forRoot()`. The result is that the root application module imports `RouterModule.forRoot(...)` and gets a `Router`, whereas all route components import `RouterModule` which does not include the `Router`.

If you have a module which provides both providers and declarations, use this pattern to separate them out.

A module that adds providers to the application can offer a
facility for configuring those providers as well through the
`forRoot()` method.

`forRoot()` takes a service configuration object and returns a
[ModuleWithProviders](api/core/ModuleWithProviders), which is
a simple object with the following properties:

* `ngModule`: in this example, the `CoreModule` class.

* `providers`: the configured providers.

   `providers` - 配置好的服务提供商

In the <live-example name="ngmodules">live example</live-example>
the root `AppModule` imports the `CoreModule` and adds the
`providers` to the `AppModule` providers. Specifically,
Angular accumulates all imported providers
before appending the items listed in `@NgModule.providers`.
This sequence ensures that whatever you add explicitly to
the `AppModule` providers takes precedence over the providers
of imported modules.

Import `CoreModule` and use its `forRoot()` method one time, in `AppModule`, because it registers services and you only want to register those services one time in your app. If you were to register them more than once, you could end up with multiple instances of the service and a runtime error.

You can also add a `forRoot()` method in the `CoreModule` that configures
the core `UserService`.

In the following example, the optional, injected `UserServiceConfig`
extends the core `UserService`. If a `UserServiceConfig` exists, the `UserService` sets the user name from that config.

<code-example path="ngmodules/src/app/core/user.service.ts" region="ctor" title="src/app/core/user.service.ts (constructor)" linenums="false">

</code-example>

Here's `forRoot()` that takes a `UserServiceConfig` object:

<code-example path="ngmodules/src/app/core/core.module.ts" region="for-root" title="src/app/core/core.module.ts (forRoot)" linenums="false">

</code-example>

Lastly, call it within the `imports` list of the `AppModule`.

最后，我们在`AppModule`的`imports`*列表*中调用它。

<code-example path="ngmodules/src/app/app.module.ts" region="import-for-root" title="src/app/app.module.ts (imports)" linenums="false">

</code-example>

The app displays "Miss Marple" as the user instead of the default "Sherlock Holmes".

该应用不再显示默认的 “Sherlock Holmes”，而是用 “Miss Marple” 作为用户名称。

Remember to _import_ `CoreModule` as a Javascript import at the top of the file; don't add it to more than one `@NgModule` `imports` list.

<!-- KW--Does this mean that if we need it elsewhere we only import it at the top? I thought the services would all be available since we were importing it into `AppModule` in `providers`. -->

## Prevent reimport of the `CoreModule`

Only the root `AppModule` should import the `CoreModule`. If a
lazy-loaded module imports it too, the app can generate
[multiple instances](guide/ngmodule-faq#q-why-bad) of a service.

To guard against a lazy-loaded module re-importing `CoreModule`, add the following `CoreModule` constructor.

<code-example path="ngmodules/src/app/core/core.module.ts" region="ctor" title="src/app/core/core.module.ts" linenums="false">

</code-example>

The constructor tells Angular to inject the `CoreModule` into itself.
The injection would be circular if Angular looked for
`CoreModule` in the _current_ injector. The `@SkipSelf`
decorator means "look for `CoreModule` in an ancestor
injector, above me in the injector hierarchy."

If the constructor executes as intended in the `AppModule`,
there would be no ancestor injector that could provide an instance of `CoreModule` and the injector should give up.

By default, the injector throws an error when it can't
find a requested provider.
The `@Optional` decorator means not finding the service is OK.
The injector returns `null`, the `parentModule` parameter is null,
and the constructor concludes uneventfully.

默认情况下，当注入器找不到想找的提供商时，会抛出一个错误。
但`@Optional`装饰器表示找不到该服务也无所谓。
于是注入器会返回`null`，`parentModule`参数也就被赋成了空值，而构造函数没有任何异常。

It's a different story if you improperly import `CoreModule` into a lazy-loaded module such as `CustomersModule`.

Angular creates a lazy-loaded module with its own injector,
a _child_ of the root injector.
`@SkipSelf` causes Angular to look for a `CoreModule` in the parent injector, which this time is the root injector.
Of course it finds the instance imported by the root `AppModule`.
Now `parentModule` exists and the constructor throws the error.

Angular 创建一个惰性加载模块，它具有自己的注入器，它是根注入器的*子注入器*。
`@SkipSelf`让 Angular 在其父注入器中查找`CoreModule`，这次，它的父注入器却是根注入器了（而上次父注入器是空）。
当然，这次它找到了由根模块`AppModule`导入的实例。
该构造函数检测到存在`parentModule`，于是抛出一个错误。
