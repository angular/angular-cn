# Contributing to resources.json

## About this list

We maintain a small list of some of the top Angular resources from across the community, stored in `resources.json`. This list is not intended to be comprehensive, but to act as a starting point to connect Angular developers to the rest of the community.

## How do I get listed?

While we can't accept all contributions, qualifying contributions can be submitted via a PR adding yourself to the `resources.json` file. All contributions should be in the appropriate section and must meet the following criteria:

1. Your contribution must be valid, and contain a link to a page talking specifically about using Angular

1. Your contribution should have a clear and concise title and description

1. Your resource should follow our brand guidelines (see our [Presskit](https://angular.io/presskit))

1. Your resource should have significant benefit to Angular developers

1. Your resource should already have traction and praise from Angular developers
